# OrthodoxFastingCalendar
The rules for Orthodox fasting can get tricky around the major holidays, so let's use algorithms to produce easy-to-follow calendars.

This program specifically follows the rules from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada. Their rules are not drastically different to other Orthodox Churches' rules. For example, some churches may fast on Mondays in addition to Wednesdays and Fridays. The pdf in the repo can be found in the article (https://www.uocc.ca/articles/fasting-rules/) or in the direct link (https://www.uocc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Fasting-Rules.pdf).
